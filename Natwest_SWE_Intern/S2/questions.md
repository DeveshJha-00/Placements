# Question 1
Was a lengthy story based question, which essentially boiled down to : 
Given an array of size N, return the sum of the 2 numbers having the maximum product. Array may contain both +ve and -ve elements. 

```
Sample Case: arr = "[3,6,9,8,4]"
Output: 17  
```

Explanation: `9 and 8 give the highest product (72) and their sum is 17`

```
Sample Case: arr = "[3,6,-9,-7,4]"
Output: -16  
```

Explanation: `-9 and -7 give the highest product (63) and their sum is -16`



# Question 2
Given an array, print all the elements of the array *in-order* where each element appears only once. 

```
Sample Case: arr = [-8,0,3,1,6,2,1,0,6,-8,2]
Output: [-8,0,3,1,6,2]
```
